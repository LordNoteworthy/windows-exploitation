* The general algorithm for the __token stealing__ shellcode is:
    - Save the drivers registers so we can restore them later and avoid crashing it.
    - Find the _KPRCB struct by looking in the fs segment register
    - Find the _KTHREAD structure corresponding to the current thread by indexing into _KPRCB.
    - Find the _EPROCESS structure corresponding to the current process by indexing into _KTHREAD.
    - Look for the _EPROCESS structure corresponding to the process with PID=4 (UniqueProcessId = 4) by walking the doubly linked list of all _EPROCESS structures that the _EPROCRESS structure contains a references to, this is the "System" process that always has SID ( Security Identifier) = NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID.
    - Retrieve the address of the Token of that process.
    - Look for the _EPROCESS structure corresponding to the process we want to escalate (our process).
    - Replace the Token of the target process with the Token of the "System" process.
    - Clean up our stack and reset our registers before returning.

* The process for exploiting a __null pointer dereference__ is:
    - Map the NULL page in user space.
    - Place a fake data structure in it which will cause our shell code to be executed.
    - Trigger the dereference bug.
