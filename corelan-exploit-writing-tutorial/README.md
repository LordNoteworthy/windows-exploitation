### Commands
* Register it as a _post-mortem_ debugger using `windbg -I` (HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Auto : set to 0)
* Note : there are other ways to get opcode addresses:
	- findjmp (from Ryan Permeh) : compile findjmp.c and run with the following parameters :
	- the metasploit opcode database
	- memdump (see one of the next tutorial posts
	- pvefindaddr, a plugin for Immunity Debugger. In fact, this one is highly recommended because it will automatically filter unreliable pointers.
* !mona findmsp
	- will tell you which registers are pointing to the shellcode and which one is more suitable (according to length).
	- will tell you at which offset EIP get overwritten.
* !mona jmp -r esp
	- will tell you an address which contains a JMP ESP.
* !mona seh
* Keep in mind that we will need to reverse the byte order due to the Little Endian architecture of the CPU. Observe the syntax below.
- msfvenom -l payloads: to list payloads
- msfencode takes a -b switch to exclude bad chars.
* badchars: “\x00\x0a\x0d\x1a“
